## CS50P Solutions
My solutions to CS50P's problem sets. I manually checked the results of each program instead of using check50.

## Do not plagiarize
"Note that CS50â€™s staff audits submissions to CS50P. Students found to be in violation of the Academic Honesty policy will be removed from the course and deemed ineligible for a certificate."

##Run the following command to install the packages used in the problem sets - recommended to used a contained virtual environment:
pip install -r requirements.txt
