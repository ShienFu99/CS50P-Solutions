# Description: Program contains Jar class -> Represents a cookie jar
# > Initializes with a default capacity of 12 and 0 cookies
# > User can deposit or withdraw cookies from the jar -> Capacity cannot be exceeded and jar must contain a positive number of cookies or 0
# > Jar only accepts integer values
# Note: It seems like size was meant to be included in __init__ as the getter was given, otherwise it would be useless. This might be seen as changing the given parameters.
